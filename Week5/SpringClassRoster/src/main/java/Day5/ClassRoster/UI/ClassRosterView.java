/*
 * All we have done is move the functionality for printing the menu and getting the user's selection
 * from the controller over to the view. Notice that we're using composition here â€” the ClassRosterView
 * has-a UserIO member and it uses UserIO to interact with the user.
 * Remember that UserIO is an interface. As we have mentioned, programming to interfaces
 * is a pattern that we'll use throughout the rest of the course.
 * ClassRosterView uses the public interface, UserIO, and is unaware of the implementation details
 * of the concrete implementation, UserIOConsoleImpl. In other words, ClassRosterView is unaware that it
 * is writing to and reading from the console, it only knows that it is interacting with the user.
